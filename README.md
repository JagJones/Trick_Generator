# Project_Name
Trick_Generator

## Description:
```
This web pg is a mobile-first, ongoing project which continually adds new content to the games and tricks sections. Clicking either button should generate a random video from it's corresponding category, and should open in a new web pg.

It's also meant to both look and act in a minimalistic manner.

```

## CSS Features:
```
. Flexbox was used throughout the entire project, except in the hamburger menu. (More info in the @media sections below.)
    - For the navigation menu at both the larger viewport sizes.
    - At the largest viewport size the main conent should seperate into 3 columns. The contents of the first column should wrap.
. CSS was used to create shapes, the little lavender dots to seperate some paragraphs and content.
. Selector types that were used: 
    .class and #ids
    :first-child and :nth-child 
    input/button[type=""]
    
```

## JavaScript Features:
```
. function burgNav() was created for the hamburger navigation. 
. function playRandomTVid()/playRandomGVid() were created to open a new window once either button was clicked. Then a random video plays from an array.

```
## Other Features: 
```
. There's 2 sizes of @media used in this project: 
    - One is a (max-width: 724px)
    . The navigation switches from a hamburger menu to a simple colum layout.

    - The other is (min-width: 1025px)
    .The navigation switches to one line.
    . The image in the main content gets larger. 
    . Main content breaks into 3 columns. First column wraps to fill the pg height, the other 2 are supposed to be realitively even and aligned next to each other.
